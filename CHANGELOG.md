## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **The core loop**: friction-free brain-dump, a Today sized to be doable, tap-to-finish with a soft sage check, gentle close-the-day, and push-a-task-to-tomorrow.
- **AI: Break it down** (the phased planner): three qualifying questions, then a review-and-accept plan; long-horizon tasks return a roadmap and only phase one is broken into steps now. Haiku clarify, Sonnet decompose; dates computed on-device.
- **AI: Sort for me** (triage, Haiku) and **Strategise** (Sonnet) to re-spread an over-full day, always propose-then-accept.
- **Slices** (track a task in parts) and **recurring tasks** (daily / weekly / every-N) with a Repeating drawer. No streaks.
- **The Lookback**: an interactive month calendar of what you finished each day, with a warmer mark for a long-dreaded "big win".
- **The AI scrapbook**: turn a finished week into a calm still-life keepsake (Cloudflare Workers AI), the objects evoking the tasks, with the week's finished tasks listed beneath.
- **Cloud sync (opt-in)**: passwordless email-OTP sign-in, last-write-wins sync, soft-delete tombstones, anonymous→account migration. Local-first throughout.
- **MCP server** (`/mcp`): a stateless bearer-token Model Context Protocol server so AI agents can add, list and complete tasks under the user's own RLS.
- **Comfort & access**: light / dark / system theme (Dusk palette), text size, reduce-motion, native fonts (Newsreader + Atkinson Hyperlegible), an accessibility pass, and an opt-in daily reminder.
- **Multi-language** AI replies (English, Italian, Spanish, French).
- **Privacy policy** (in-app + public URL) and **account + data deletion**.
- **The moat**: pseudonymous AI-call telemetry, instrumented from day one.
- **End-to-end manual test suite** (`docs/qa/`): 60 cases, fillable `.xlsx` + readable `.md`.
- Initial golden-path scaffold (Inspector, tiered CI, playbook, doc tiers).

### Changed
- Moat telemetry moved from a Supabase table to **Cloudflare D1** (Worker-bound).

### Security
- **AI endpoints locked down**: CORS allowlist + Origin gate + per-IP rate limit.
- **No public telemetry write path**: telemetry is a Worker-bound Cloudflare D1 database (previously a Supabase table written with the public anon key).
- The Anthropic key is isolated to the Worker; the MCP server holds no elevated key (it acts only with the user's own token, under RLS).
